# Conway's Game of Life

[Deployment ðŸš€](https://gameoflife-ace.netlify.app/)

Check out this classic computer science program replicated using the React framework! John Conway's "Game of Life" simulates _cellular automaton_ by following a few set of rules for cells on a grid.

Rules:
- An alive cell will continue to live if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors.
- Likewise, and alive cell will die if it has less than 2, or more than 3 live 
neighbors.
- A cell will come alive when it has exactly 3 neighbors.
